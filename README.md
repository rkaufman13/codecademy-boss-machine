# Boss Machine

## Project Overview

I finished the "Boss Machine" project on CodeCademy to practice CRUD functions. In this project, the front-end, a thorough test suite, and a handful of helper functions to interact with a "database" are provided, and my job was to create the backend server with express. The final product is a "machine" to help evil villains manage their minions and million-dollar ideas for world domination.
